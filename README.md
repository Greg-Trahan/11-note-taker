## Description

The goal of this application is to allow the user to take and review notes which will be stored on a server.

## Usage

This application can be used to keep notes on upcoming things to do.

## What I did

I built the server side of a program that takes a user input for a new to-do item and a title and puts it into a to-do list that is stored on a server.

## What I learned

I learned about how to use Express to initiate a server, as well as how to ping the server for information and pass it new information.
